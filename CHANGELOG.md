# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- **Renamed to Coop.** The binary is now `coop`, the image is `coop-box`, config
  lives in `~/.config/coop`, and env vars use the `COOP_` prefix (previously
  `agent-box` / `agent` / `AGENT_`). `install.sh` migrates an existing
  `~/.config/agent-box/agents` over on upgrade.
- The loop rides out rate limits. When the model hits a rate or usage limit
  mid-run, `coop loop` no longer spins on a fixed retry — it parses the reset
  time from the agent's own output (Claude's `usage limit reached|<epoch>`, or a
  `retry-after` delay), waits until then with a countdown, and resumes the same
  item, so an unattended overnight run survives the daily cap instead of burning
  retries against it. Non-limit failures back off and stop after a few in a row.
- Unified working directory and history across modes. `coop`, `coop loop`, and
  `coop acp` now all mount the repo at its real host path (not `/workspace`), so
  each agent's per-project session history is shared — a thread you started with
  `coop loop` is there to resume when you open the repo in Zed. `COOP_WORKDIR`
  still overrides the mount path for the old `/workspace` behavior.
- One-line install + releases: `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh` downloads the
  prebuilt binary (no Go, no clone). GoReleaser publishes cross-platform binaries
  — with auto-generated, categorized release notes — to GitHub Releases on every
  `v*` tag. CI runs gofmt, vet, staticcheck,
  tests, build, and shellcheck.
- Updated to current toolchain + base images: Go 1.26; GitHub Actions checkout
  v6, setup-go v6, goreleaser-action v7; the box base on node:24 (LTS); and the
  scaffolded stacks on python 3.14 / golang 1.26 / elixir 1.20-otp-29 /
  postgres 18 / redis 8.
- Rewritten in Go: `coop` is now a single static binary (no bash, no runtime
  dependencies) built with `go build`. Same commands, same box, same
  secret-shadowing — faithfully ported, with the security core (mount
  computation and run-arg assembly) now pure and unit-tested, and proven
  end-to-end by `coop doctor`.
- Native MCP generation: Gemini's `settings.json` and Codex's `config.toml` are
  produced in Go, so the host no longer needs `python3` for any agent's MCP.
- `coop init` templates and the workflow skills are embedded in the binary, so
  scaffolding needs no repo checkout (a step toward a fork-free install).
- Config moved to `~/.config/coop/` (XDG): `agents/`, `mcp.json`,
  `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `env`, and `coop.conf` live there, decoupled from any repo.
  `install.sh` seeds it from an existing in-repo `agents/` on upgrade. The conf
  file is parsed as `KEY=VALUE` lines (the environment still wins over it).
- `coop help` and `coop version` no longer require a container runtime.
- Claude login now persists. The box sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to the mounted
  `~/.claude`, so Claude's account/onboarding state — which it keeps in
  `~/.claude.json` in `$HOME` — survives the disposable container instead of being
  lost every run (a latent bug from the bash version too; credentials already
  persisted, but without the config file Claude re-showed its login screen).
- Terminal detection uses a real isatty ioctl rather than a character-device
  check, so `coop run … < /dev/null` (and other char-device stdin) no longer
  wrongly requests a docker tty.
- Fresh boxes skip Claude's first-run prompts. Each run pre-answers the theme
  picker, the folder-trust dialog, and the bypass-permissions warning (the box is
  the sandbox) by seeding `settings.json` and `.claude.json` in the mounted config
  — merged, so the login and any settings you've chosen are preserved. A fresh
  install goes straight from one login to working.

## 1.6.0

- One file, every agent's MCP: define servers once in `agents/mcp.json` (the
  standard `{"mcpServers": {...}}` shape) and `coop` wires them into all three
  on launch — Claude via `--mcp-config`, Gemini merged into its `settings.json`,
  Codex converted to `[mcp_servers.*]` in its `config.toml`. The Gemini/Codex
  configs are generated read-only on top of your existing files (never modifying
  them; `mcp.json` wins on a name clash), which needs `python3` on the host;
  Claude needs nothing. `cp agents/mcp.json.example agents/mcp.json` to start.

## 1.5.0

- `coop acp [claude|codex|gemini]` — run the box as an ACP agent over stdio, so
  editors like Zed can drive the sandboxed agent. Mounts the repo at its real
  host path (so the editor's absolute paths resolve), attaches stdin without a
  pty, and keeps secrets shadowed. Point Zed's `agent_servers` at
  `command: "agent", args: ["acp", "claude"]`.
- The default image now bakes in the ACP adapters (`@zed-industries/claude-code-acp`,
  `@zed-industries/codex-acp`; Gemini's is built in) and trusts any git worktree
  (`safe.directory '*'`) so git works on the host-path mount.

## 1.4.0

- Ship generic workflow skills — `/plan`, `/work`, `/batch`, `/verify-api` — under
  `skills/`. `coop init` installs them into the repo's shared `.claude/skills/`
  (Codex gets them via the symlink), without clobbering ones you've edited, and
  the generated `AGENTS.md` points the agent at them. Adapted from the production
  set (emisar), with the repo-specific parts (Iron Laws, Elixir contexts) removed.

## 1.3.0

- `coop init` now scaffolds the full `.agent/` working set — `TASKS.md`,
  `BACKLOG.md`, `LOG.md`, `PENDING_DECISIONS.md`, `IDEAS.md`, `rules/` — and the
  generated `AGENTS.md` documents each one's role, so the canonical manual that's
  re-injected after a compaction tells the agent how to use them. Matches the
  layout used in production (emisar). Everything but `rules/` stays git-ignored.

## 1.2.0

- `coop dispatch <name>` — the fleet unit: clone into an isolated workspace,
  seed it with that agent's queue slice (`.agent/TASKS.<name>.md`), run the loop.
- `coop init` now wires the tool-neutral setup: `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`
  symlink to the canonical `AGENTS.md`, and `.codex/skills` shares
  `.claude/skills`. Real (non-symlink) instruction files are never clobbered.
- Explicit `COOP_IMAGE` now overrides image selection (lets a dispatched clone
  reuse its origin's image); `COOP_SERVICES_NET` lets a fleet share one db/redis.
- Source-guarded entrypoint (`main`) so the script is unit-testable; added
  `test/unit.sh`, a `Makefile`, and CI (shellcheck + unit tests).

## 1.1.0

- Three agents in one box: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, each with autonomous
  defaults; `coop login <agent>`.
- Per-agent auth + settings in `agents/<agent>/`, mounted into the box; `agents/env`
  for API keys; one `agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` wired into all three agents' native
  instruction paths, with per-agent overrides taking precedence.
- Per-project environments: `coop init --stack <elixir|python|go|node>` writes a
  `Dockerfile.agent` (toolchain) and `compose.agent.yml` (services); `coop up`/
  `down` run sibling Postgres/Redis the box reaches by name; per-project image tags.

## 1.0.0

- The box: `coop` runs a sandboxed agent on the current repo, with repo secrets
  shadowed out of reach (tmpfs over secret dirs, read-only decoys over secret files).
- `coop doctor` proves isolation by attacking it; `coop clone` hands off a
  secrets-free workspace with no reachable remote.
- The autonomous loop: `coop loop` works `.agent/TASKS.md` with disposable
  sessions and an audit pass; `coop init` scaffolds the queue + Stop/commit hooks.
