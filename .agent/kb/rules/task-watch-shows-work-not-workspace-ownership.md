# Show work in tasks watch, not idle workspace ownership

`coop tasks watch` answers what task work is happening. A remote-session reservation alone is
durable ownership of a reusable workspace, not activity: it does not render a `forks` row and does
not make an otherwise empty board visible. Keep the reservation in the project JSON snapshot and
all lifecycle checks. If that same fork has an assignment, worker startup, detached loop, cleanup,
candidate, land, or execution, show the task-affecting state without exposing the session owner id.

A running box is not a second inventory either. The board carries no per-execution block: a box or
session that belongs to a task shows on that task's own row (`← fork`), and one that does not has
nothing to say to somebody reading the queue. The execution data stays in the snapshot, where
activity accounting, auto-exit and `--json` read it.

**Why:** After the watcher filled its lower half with idle `remote-* · remote-session remote_*`
rows, the user said, "I don't see why forks should be shown in tasks watch" (2026-09-02). Those
opaque ownership ids hid the task queue without describing work.

**How to apply:** Treat snapshot collection and terminal presentation as separate boundaries.
Preserve every reservation in `ReadProjectSnapshot`/`--json`; in the terminal renderer, use one
shared activity predicate that excludes reservation-only state. Do not render executions at all,
and keep standalone fork rows only for lifecycle states that affect task progress.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-11 — the `sandboxes` block is gone with the CLI design's task-family revision; the same
  boundary now holds all the way (snapshot keeps every execution, the terminal shows tasks). The
  card's check follows the renamed regression test.
- 2026-09-02 — created after sweeping every `snapshot.Forks` and `fork.Reservation` consumer.
  The two terminal visibility predicates and reservation-first label were the only presentation
  violations; lifecycle status, workspace cleanup, and JSON snapshot consumers remain unchanged.
